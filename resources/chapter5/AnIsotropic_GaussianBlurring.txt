I have an anisotropic image data with image resolution 0.45x045x2.0 micrometers in each voxel.
I want to Gaussian blur this image. How can I do it in such a way that the effect of blurring is same in all the directions?
In order to apply a Gaussian blur to an image so that the effect of the blur is the same in all directions, you will need to use an isotropic Gaussian kernel. An isotropic Gaussian kernel is a kernel that has the same standard deviation in all directions, unlike an anisotropic kernel which has different standard deviation in different directions.

chatGpt:
You can use the scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter function to apply a Gaussian blur to your image. The function takes in the image as well as the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in all directions.

Copy code
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

# Define standard deviation for the kernel 
std_dev = 1

# Apply the Gaussian filter to the image
blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, std_dev)
Keep in mind that this process can reduce the resolution of your image, so you will probably want to adjust the standard deviation of the kernel to trade off between blurring and resolution.

Also, the pixel voxel resolution you provided in the question is 2x0.45x0.45 micrometer, if this is what you would like to maintain you may need to adjust the standard deviation according to the resolution of your image in order to achieve the desired level of blurring.

I am sorry, I did not understand.

My image is not isotropic in nature. It is anisotropic. How can I ensure proper Gaussian blurring on an anisotropic image?
An anisotropic image is an image where the resolution or the scale of the features in the image varies in different directions. In other words, the voxels of the image are not of same size in all directions.

chatGpt:
When you apply a Gaussian blur to an anisotropic image using a standard isotropic kernel, the blur will not be the same in all directions because the image has different resolutions in different directions.

One way to handle this is to use an anisotropic Gaussian kernel, which has different standard deviations in different directions. The standard deviation in the direction of the highest resolution should be smaller than in the direction of the lowest resolution to ensure that the blurring effect is consistent across the entire image.

You can use scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter function with sigma parameter as the array that represent the standard deviation of the kernel along the respective direction.

Copy code
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

# Define standard deviation for the kernel along each direction
std_dev = [1,2,3]

# Apply the Gaussian filter to the image
blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, std_dev)
You can also use other packages like skimage or cv2 which also provide functionality to apply anisotropic blur.

Keep in mind that it may be a bit more challenging to adjust the standard deviation of the kernel in different directions, so you may need to experiment to find the right settings that produce the desired level of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image.

How to know the standard deviation in each direction?

chatGpt:
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in each direction is related to the resolution of the image in that direction. One way to estimate the standard deviation for an anisotropic image is by determining the resolution of the image in each direction and using that to calculate the standard deviation of the kernel.

For example, you can use the resolution of the voxel in each direction (length, width and height) and convert them to standard deviation. For voxel resolution 2x0.45x0.45 micrometer, assuming x, y and z are the respective direction, you can calculate the standard deviation as follows:

Copy code
std_dev = [resolution_x/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_y/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_z/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2)))]
You can use these values as standard deviation for the kernel along the respective direction.

It is worth noting that, above calculation are based on some assumptions like, your image is Gaussian-like and the desired level of blur is also based on Gaussian blur. In practice, you may need to experiment with different values of standard deviation to find the right setting that produce the desired level of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image.

Another way to estimate the standard deviation of the kernel is to use a specialized method based on the structure of your image such as mathematical morphological approach, or using validation data with known structure.

Can I do it in Fiji?
Yes, you can use the image processing software Fiji (which is built on top of ImageJ) to apply a Gaussian blur to an anisotropic image.

In Fiji, you can use the "Anisotropic Diffusion" plugin to apply an anisotropic Gaussian blur to your image. This plugin allows you to specify different standard deviations for the kernel in different directions.

Open your image in Fiji.
Go to the "Plugins" menu, then select "Diffusion" and "Anisotropic Diffusion"
In the plugin dialog, you can enter the standard deviation for the kernel in the "Diffusivity" field for each direction, you can also adjust the number of iterations for the filter.
Click on "OK" to apply the filter.
Note that, above method will work for 2D images, If your image is 3D, you will have to extract 2D planes and then apply the anisotropic diffusion and later combine the planes.

Also, like the previous mentioned method, this method also assumes the image is Gaussian-like, and that the desired level of blur is based on Gaussian blur, so you may have to experiment with different settings to find the right values that produce the desired level of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image.

What is the standard deviation used when I am working on isotropic image?
When working with an isotropic image, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is a scalar value that represents the width of the kernel in all directions.

For example, if you want to apply a Gaussian blur to an isotropic image using the scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter function, you can use the same standard deviation value for the kernel in all directions, like this:

Copy code
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

# Define standard deviation for the kernel 
std_dev = 1

# Apply the Gaussian filter to the image
blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, std_dev)
The value of standard deviation to use will depend on the desired level of blur and the specific characteristics of the image. Larger values of standard deviation will result in more blurring, while smaller values will result in less blurring.

A commonly used rule of thumb for the size of the kernel is to use a standard deviation that is equal to the size of the smallest feature of interest in your image, divided by 2.35. This will ensure that the kernel is large enough to capture most of the information in the smallest feature while still producing a perceptible blur.

Keep in mind that, like in case of anisotropic images, assumptions like the image is Gaussian-like and the desired level of blur is based on Gaussian blur applies here too, So you may have to experiment with different values of standard deviation to find the right settings that produce the desired level of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image.

I thought Gaussian blur is always controlled by sigma. Is sigma somehow related to standard deviation?
Yes, in the context of Gaussian blur, sigma (σ) is a parameter that is closely related to the standard deviation of the kernel. In fact, sigma is often used as an alternative way to specify the standard deviation.

A Gaussian kernel is defined by a bell-shaped probability density function, which is parameterized by a mean (μ) and a standard deviation (σ). The standard deviation determines the width of the kernel, and it is directly related to how much blurring will be applied. A larger standard deviation results in more blurring, while a smaller standard deviation results in less blurring.

In image processing, when we talk about Gaussian blur, we often use sigma instead of standard deviation because it allows for more intuitive control of the kernel. The standard deviation of a Gaussian kernel can be calculated from the sigma value by multiplying it with a scaling factor of 2.35. When specifying the sigma value of the kernel, it is more intuitive because it corresponds more closely with the perceived amount of blur.

For example, in scipy ndimage function gaussian_filter, the parameter sigma is used to define the standard deviation of the kernel.

Copy code
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

# Define sigma for the kernel 
sigma = 1

# Apply the Gaussian filter to the image
blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, sigma)
In other software packages like skimage and cv2, they also use sigma to control the standard deviation of the kernel.

std_dev = [resolution_x/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_y/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_z/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2)))]


You gave this formula to calculate std_dev in each direction. Can you tell me more about how you arrived at this?
The formula I provided for calculating the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in each direction:

Copy code
std_dev = [resolution_x/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_y/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2))), resolution_z/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2)))]
is based on the relationship between the standard deviation of a Gaussian function and the size of the kernel. It is a common rule of thumb in image processing to use a kernel that is large enough to capture most of the information in the smallest feature of interest while still producing a perceptible blur.

The standard deviation (σ) of a Gaussian function controls the width of the kernel. In one dimension, the Gaussian function is defined as:

Copy code
f(x) = (1/(σ * sqrt(2*π))) * e^(-x^2 / (2*σ^2))
Where x is the spatial coordinate and σ is the standard deviation. The Gaussian function is symmetric around the mean (μ) so the kernel is centered around the mean and most of the weights (probability density) are within σ of the mean. The area under the curve is equal to 1, so the sum of all the weights is 1.

A commonly used rule of thumb for the size of the kernel is to use a standard deviation that is equal to the size of the smallest feature of interest in your image, divided by 2.35. This ensures that the kernel is large enough to capture most of the information in the smallest feature while still producing a perceptible blur.

So the formula I provided uses the inverse of this rule of thumb to find the standard deviation required to achieve blur that covers a feature of a given size. by multiplying the resolution of image with 2.35 and then taking the reciprocal of it, you get the standard deviation that covers the size of feature equivalent to the resolution of the image in that direction.

Copy code
std_dev = resolution/(2*math.sqrt(2*math.log(2)))
You can apply this formula in each direction to calculate the standard deviation for each direction and use this value for the respective direction.

So, the size of the smallest feature is given by the resolution of my voxel?
Yes, when working with an anisotropic image, the resolution of the voxel is often used as a rough estimate of the size of the smallest feature of interest in the image. In such a scenario, you can use the resolution in each direction (length, width and height) to calculate the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in that direction.

When the voxel size represents the resolution of the image in all directions the resolution of voxel is used as a proxy for the size of the smallest feature of interest in the image. So it becomes the natural choice for size of smallest feature of interest in anisotropic images, and as such, can be used to guide the selection of standard deviation for the kernel in each direction.

Keep in mind that this is only a rough estimate and that the actual size of the smallest feature of interest in your image may be different. In practice, you may need to experiment with different values of standard deviation in each direction to find the right settings that produce the desired level of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image.

Why do we normally ignore these fine considerations when working with isotropic images? What is the size of the smallest feature we assume in such scenarios?
When working with isotropic images, it is generally assumed that the resolution of the image is the same in all directions, and as such, it is common to use a single scalar value for the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. This simplifies the process of applying the blur, and in many cases, produces good results.

In isotropic images, the size of the smallest feature we assume is, in fact, defined by the resolution of the image. The isotropic resolution of the image is used as a proxy for the size of the smallest feature of interest in the image. So when the image resolution is isotropic, it becomes natural to use a single scalar value for the standard deviation that is equal to the resolution of the image divided by 2.35.

The reason why we can ignore the detailed considerations when working with isotropic images is that, unlike in anisotropic images, the resolution of the image is the same in all directions, so the size of the smallest feature of interest is also the same in all directions. This means that a single scalar value for the standard deviation of the kernel can be used to achieve the desired level of blurring across the entire image, so it's not required to use different standard deviation for different directions.

But it's worth noting that in practice, the image may not be perfectly isotropic even when the voxels are isotropic, and the size of the smallest feature of interest may vary slightly in different regions of the image. In such cases, a single scalar value for the standard deviation may not be sufficient to achieve the desired level of blurring, and more detailed considerations may be required.

So, now, if I wish to construct a pyramid of Gaussian blurring. How must I choose the values?
When constructing a pyramid of Gaussian blurring, the process consists of repeatedly applying a Gaussian blur to the image at multiple scales, with the goal of creating a representation of the image at different levels of detail.

In this scenario, you will need to choose the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel for each level of the pyramid. A common approach is to use a fixed ratio between the standard deviation at each level of the pyramid.

For example, you can start by blurring the image with a large standard deviation (e.g., 5), then use a smaller standard deviation (e.g., 2) for the next level of the pyramid, and continue to decrease the standard deviation by a fixed ratio (e.g., 2) at each level. This can be useful when the smallest feature size is known, but to get more accurate results in practice, you may want to experiment with different ratios and standard deviations.

Alternatively, you can also use a pyramid decomposition algorithm such as Laplacian Pyramid that uses different standard deviations for each level of pyramid and keeps the information of fine details with small standard deviation and less detail with large standard deviation.

Also, when constructing pyramid, another important consideration is how many levels you want the pyramid to have. The number of levels will depend on the specific task and the desired level of detail.

In any case, it's worth noting that in practice, you will likely need to experiment with different settings to find the right values that produce the desired levels of blurring while maintaining the resolution of the image, and that the actual settings may depend on the specific characteristics of the image, and the task you are trying to achieve.
